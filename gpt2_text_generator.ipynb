(TL Note: We haven't tried trying and that's okay as it was a very good first year in this tournament and we look forward to it all being over for people that understand how fun our team can be). Well this is what I will do this winter. So start playing StarCraft by now.. (I have already talked about my personal StarCraft experiences. In fact if I am going to go in with all the knowledge that my family will have when I go to university I am going to build those skills and experience as well…). So it might sound strange, but we already know a few good ideas for the next couple days regarding the StarCraft World Championships at Sun-School in December that we are excited for next fall! Well that just won't do for this Spring so it might actually be good to say my bad since I haven't finished as much training when first going to school for my sophomore year so I thought maybe tomorrow will be the day that I have the best chance… so enjoy the break though and I am going take in good time for the\n",
